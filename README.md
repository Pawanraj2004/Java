# Java
A collection of Java programs from easy to hard.
I have created a list of 50 programs with 25 easy and 25 medium level problems.
This list of programs will help you build logical thinking and problem solving in Java language.
Also, I have included some projects and list of OOPS concept programs.
These projects are randomly categorized into easy and medium according to my level of knowledge while creating them.
